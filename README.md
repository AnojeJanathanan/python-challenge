(PyBank Solution Summary): My PyBank Analysis depicts the act of evaluating and analyzing financial data that is derived from the 'budget_data.csv' stored in my resources folder under PyBank. The csv itself showcases financial data as well as its corresponding date records. Furthermore, my task was to solve for the 'Total Number of Month Records', 'The Net Total Amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period, 'The corresponding changes in profit/losses', 'The average of the changes as shown', and 'the Greatest Increase/Decrease in Profits (Date/Amount) as highlighted by my variables of highest/lowest respectively'. 

(PyPoll Solution Summary): The PyPoll Analysis is based on an EXTREMELY large csv file. The script is designated to deeply analyze the poll data to extract and output KPIs such as 'The Total Number of Votes Cast', 'A complete list of candidates who recieved, 'The percentage of votes that each candidate won', the 'Total Number of votes each candidate won', and 'The Winner'.
